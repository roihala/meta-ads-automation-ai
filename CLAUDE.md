# CLAUDE.md

## Overview

**Campaigner** is a Meta Ads automation agent for **Aiweon** — an AI-based digital marketing agency and SaaS platform in Israel. The agent evaluates, optimizes, creates, and iterates paid ad campaigns on Meta (Facebook/Instagram) with Human-in-the-Loop approvals.

- **Design philosophy:** Claude Code Native + Terminal First (MVP). LangGraph orchestration deferred to v2.
- **HITL:** every agent decision writes a row to Supabase `approvals`; execution happens only after human approval (CLI or web).
- **Scope MVP:** one business (Aiweon), Facebook + Instagram, Hebrew, single Meta ad account.
- **Fork of:** `sandhere01/meta-ads-automation-ai`. This is a **bemtech client project**.

## 🧭 Core Knowledge (READ BEFORE EDITING)

These three documents are canonical — **anything you write in code, prompts, or guardrails must align with them:**

## 🎨 Design System

The web app and any future surface follow the **"Warm Industrial Editorial"** design system — a portable token + component layer originally authored as a Claude Design handoff. Treat it as canonical for anything visual.

| Asset                                                                                                       | Role                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`docs/design/aiweon-handoff/project/design-system.html`](docs/design/aiweon-handoff/project/design-system.html) | **Source of truth.** Open in a browser to see every token, component, and pattern (color, type, spacing, buttons, cards, status pills, agent cards, chat bubbles, top-bar pills, full RTL Hebrew coverage). |
| [`docs/design/aiweon-handoff/README.md`](docs/design/aiweon-handoff/README.md)                              | Handoff context from the original design tool.                                                                                    |
| [`docs/design/aiweon-handoff/chats/chat1.md`](docs/design/aiweon-handoff/chats/chat1.md)                    | Design conversation — why amber + sage, why the pill top bar, what "subtle" means here. Read before changing the palette.         |
| [`web/src/app/globals.css`](web/src/app/globals.css)                                                        | **Implementation.** All design-system CSS variables, base styles, component classes, and Tailwind layer mappings.                 |
| [`web/tailwind.config.ts`](web/tailwind.config.ts)                                                          | Tailwind tokens (font families, scale, radii, shadows, brand/sage colour palettes) wired to the same variables.                   |
| [`web/src/app/layout.tsx`](web/src/app/layout.tsx)                                                          | Loads the five brand fonts (Outfit · Rubik · Heebo · Frank Ruhl Libre · JetBrains Mono) via `next/font`.                          |

**Naming caveat:** the original design system calls the brand amber `--accent`. In our codebase that name conflicts with shadcn's neutral hover-bg token, so the brand colour lives under `--brand` / `--brand-hover` / `--brand-tint`. The design-system component classes copied into `globals.css` were rewritten accordingly.

**When changing visual design:** update `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`. If you're introducing a pattern that's not in the design-system source, propose adding it there too rather than letting a one-off style fork the system.

## 🗺️ Per-folder navigation (CLAUDE.md in every working directory)

When Claude's cwd matches a folder below, that folder's `CLAUDE.md` loads **in addition to** this one. Use it to find the right contract / convention without re-deriving from code.

| Folder                                                | What you'll find there                                                          |

The same docs are also accessible through standard `README.md` files where one already exists ([`web/`](web/README.md), [`migrations/`](migrations/README.md), [`tests/golden/`](tests/golden/README.md)) — those are operator-facing setup guides; the per-folder `CLAUDE.md` files are the agent-facing companions.

When you onboard a new contributor or agent: point them at this navigation map. Each folder is a self-contained unit of context.

## What This Project Does (MVP)

The agent runs stateless via `cron` → `claude -p "..."` headless invocations:

1. **Daily observe-propose** (09:00 IL): Fetches Meta snapshot, evaluates using the two-gate model (CAMPAIGN_EVALUATION.md), writes proposals to Supabase `approvals` table.
2. **Execute approvals** (every 15 min): Reads approved rows, re-checks guardrails, calls Meta Marketing API.
3. **Weekly creative firehose** (Mon 10:00 IL): Generates 3-5 new creatives per active campaign (Andromeda prefers 10-50+ diverse creatives; don't prune manually).
4. **Weekly competitive research** (Mon 11:00 IL): WebSearch on market prices, trending creative angles, and new ad formats in the business's vertical — emits `task_type='alert'` proposals with source-cited findings (guardrail §27 blocks unsourced competitive claims).

All decisions are logged to Supabase `agent_decisions` — replaces LangSmith/Langfuse for MVP observability.

## Architecture (MVP — Claude Code Native)

```
cron (Kubernetes CronJob, Hetzner k3s)
  → runners/*.sh → claude -p "..."
  → Claude reads CAMPAIGNER.md + prompts/*.md
  → Claude invokes Python CLI tools via Bash
  → Python tools talk to Meta (facebook-business) + Postgres
  → Decisions logged; proposals queued for human approval
```

### Existing legacy files

**Still in active use (imported by `campaigner/lib/`)** — kept at the repo root:

| File                  | Role                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `meta_ads_manager.py` | `MetaAdsManager` wrapping `facebook-business` SDK — wrapped by `campaigner/lib/meta_client.py` |

The Vertex AI Imagen path (`image_generator.py` + `campaigner/lib/creative.py` + `campaigner/tools/generate_creative.py`) was retired 2026-05-26. Creative generation now runs through Clara via Playwright — see [`docs/plans/clara-video-flow.md`](docs/plans/clara-video-flow.md).

**Archived** (reference only, not imported by current code) — see [`legacy/README.md`](legacy/README.md):

| `scripts/diagnose_page_permissions.py` | Meta Page permissions diagnostic                                |

## Tech Stack (MVP)

- **Python 3.11+** + Bash runners
- **Claude Code CLI** (headless, `claude -p`) — agent orchestrator
- **Claude** (Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.6) via Anthropic API — the LLM
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + Storage) — DB + HITL queue
- **Clara** ([clarasocial.com](https://clarasocial.com/app)) via Playwright — video creative generation (Flow I; see [`docs/plans/clara-video-flow.md`](docs/plans/clara-video-flow.md))
- **Meta Marketing API** (`facebook-business`) — Meta integration
- **Hetzner k3s CronJobs** — cron runtime (production); `docker compose` for local

**Estimated MVP cost:** ~$25/month/business (Claude ~$23, Clara subscription confirmed during Phase 0 spike).

## Setup & Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

```
# LLM
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # for Claude Code headless

# Meta
META_APP_ID=...
META_APP_SECRET=...
META_ACCESS_TOKEN=...               # Expires ~60 days, manual rotation
META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID=act_...          # Must include act_ prefix
META_PAGE_ID=...

# Clara (Flow I — daily video generation)
CLARA_EMAIL=...                     # Aiweon's Clara account
CLARA_PASSWORD=...                  # Fresh Playwright login on every Flow I invocation

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
BUSINESS_ID=aiweon-uuid
```

### Install & Validate

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker compose run --rm campaigner python scripts/validate_credentials.py        # Anthropic + Meta
docker compose run --rm campaigner python scripts/diagnose_page_permissions.py   # Meta Page permissions
```

## Running

### Legacy (archived under `legacy/scripts/` — still work, reference only)

```bash
docker compose run --rm campaigner python legacy/scripts/run_automation.py     # Create 2 Aiweon ads (PAUSED)
docker compose run --rm campaigner python legacy/scripts/create_simple_ad.py   # Single ad, minimal setup
```

### MVP flows (when `campaigner/` is built)

```bash
# Manual trigger (usually cron-driven)
bash runners/daily_observe_propose.sh
bash runners/execute_approvals.sh
bash runners/weekly_creative_firehose.sh

# User CLI (terminal-first)
campaigner list --pending
campaigner approve <id>
campaigner reject <id> --reason "..."
campaigner inspect <run-id>
```

## Safety Notes

- **Real API calls**: Scripts create real objects in Meta Ads Manager and cost money (Clara video generation + Meta spend)
- **PAUSED by default**: Ads won't spend until manually activated
- **HITL is load-bearing**: Agent proposes, human approves. No autonomous execution in MVP.
- **Token expiry**: `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` expires ~60 days, no auto-refresh. Plan System User Token post-Business Verification.
- **Budget units**: Meta API `daily_budget` is in **cents** (e.g., `5000` = $50/day)
- **No cleanup**: No delete scripts — manage via Meta Ads Manager UI
- **Meta App must be in Live Mode** to publish ads to real audiences

## Deprecated Pre-Andromeda Rules (never reintroduce)

See CAMPAIGN_EVALUATION.md §8 for the full list. High-impact examples:

- ❌ Frequency > 3 as auto-kill trigger → use Meta Creative Fatigue flag (CPR ≥ 2× historical)
- ❌ 1 ad set = 1 ad structure → consolidated ad sets with 10+ diverse creatives
- ❌ Horizontal scaling by duplication → vertical (budget) scaling only; duplication resets Learning
- ❌ Narrow interest targeting → broad + Advantage+ Audience
- ❌ Manual pruning of underperforming creatives in first 48h → let Andromeda starve them; only kill if hook rate < 25%

## v2 Migration (LangGraph + Gemini)

Triggered when a **second ad account** is added to the system. Separate doc to be written at `docs/plans/langgraph-v2-migration.md`. MVP tooling (`campaigner/tools/`, `lib/`, Supabase schema) is reused; only the orchestration layer changes.

## Original Upstream

- Fork of: `sandhere01/meta-ads-automation-ai`
- Original was Brazilian real estate focused, in Portuguese
- Rewritten for Aiweon (Israel, Hebrew, Clara via Playwright, Claude Code agent)
