"""
Unit tests for `campaigner.lib.audience_targeting` — pure-function parser
that extracts a Meta saved-audience `targeting` dict into our migration-030
column shape + Hebrew summary line.

No DB, no Meta SDK — the parser is supposed to be a pure transform from
"whatever Meta returned" into "what /audiences renders." If these tests
pass, the only remaining work is the SQL upsert layer (covered by the
sync tool's contract test) and the UI rendering (covered by vitest if we
add a snapshot).
