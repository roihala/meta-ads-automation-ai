"""
HTTP-direct lead-form lookups against Meta Graph.

Phase 2 of the Campaigner Mastery Plan. Used by `sync_leads.py` to mirror Meta
Lead Ads submissions into the local `leads` table. Token model matches
`page_publishing.py` — the caller supplies a decrypted page access token
resolved via `page_tokens.get_fb_publishing_target`. We don't reuse the
facebook-business SDK because lead form endpoints behave better with explicit
HTTP and the request shapes are tiny.

Two endpoints:
  GET /{page_id}/leadgen_forms      → list Lead Forms attached to the Page
  GET /{form_id}/leads              → list submissions for one form

Both honor `since` (Unix int) and pagination. We cap iteration at 500 leads
per form per sync to bound runtime; daily cron + webhook cover the streaming
case.

Requires the user-or-page token to have `leads_retrieval` permission AND the
page-level lead access for the form. The Aiweon user token has both as of
2026-05-13 (verified via debug_token).
