"""
Resolve and decrypt page access tokens for a business — the bridge between
`businesses.meta_page_id` / selected IG and the Graph publishing helpers in
`page_publishing.py`.

The Page Access Token is what publishing endpoints require. For Facebook
posts that's straightforward (the Page's own token). For Instagram, Meta's
Graph design routes everything through a linked Page — IG publish endpoints
authenticate with the linked Page's token, not a separate IG token. We
encapsulate that here so callers don't have to know the quirk.
