"""
Seasonal multiplier — manual bridge to War Chest (v2).

Per decisions-log §1.10: `businesses.seasonal_hints` holds windows the
operator enters by hand. Each window has {start, end, multiplier, confidence}.
On any given date, the effective multiplier is the PRODUCT of multipliers of
all windows that cover that date.

Empty hints → 1.0. Overlap → product (see entry §1.10 "מה נשאר פתוח" for why).

Future v2: same shape, confidence='learned' rows get priority weighting. For
now every window is user_stated and contributes equally.
