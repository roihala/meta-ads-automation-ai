tools/fetch_lead_quality_summary.py — per-campaign lead quality aggregates.

Phase 2 of the Campaigner Mastery Plan (docs/plans/campaigner-mastery-plan.md
§5). Read by Flow A Step 1.7 — every active campaign that has leads gets a
quality summary the agent uses in Gate 2 reasoning. Without this, "winner"
classification falls back to Meta-internal metrics only (the 16.4 trap).

Returns one row per campaign with leads in the window:
  {
    business_id,
    window_days,
    campaigns: [
      {
        campaign_id, campaign_name,
        leads_total, leads_graded, leads_ungraded,
        avg_grade, grade_distribution: {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 5, ...},
        conversions, conversion_value_ils,
        quality_band: 'high' | 'mixed' | 'low' | 'insufficient_data',
        sample_lead_ids: [...]   -- first 5 ungraded leads for the operator's queue
      }
    ],
    overall: { ... same shape but business-wide ... }
  }

Quality band logic (the agent's Gate 2 input):
  - leads_total < 5            → insufficient_data
  - avg_grade >= 3.5           → high
  - avg_grade 2.5-3.49         → mixed
  - avg_grade < 2.5            → low
