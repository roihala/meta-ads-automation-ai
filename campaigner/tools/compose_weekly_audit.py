"""
tools/compose_weekly_audit.py — produce the structured 7-day summary the agent
reads to write a Hebrew operator-facing weekly digest.

Built 2026-05-13 PM as the third leg of the "agency replacement" upgrade.
Most marketing agencies send a weekly status report: what we proposed, what
the client approved, what shifted in the numbers, what's open. Until now the
agent left this to the operator to reconstruct from scrolling through the
approvals queue. Flow F (the weekly self-audit runner) calls this tool, then
asks the agent to translate the structured output into ~200 Hebrew words —
producing the "your campaign manager's weekly digest" experience.

The tool itself doesn't write narrative. It returns:
  - proposals_summary: count + breakdown by task_type + urgency
  - approval_funnel: proposed → approved → executed counts + ratios
  - rejection_patterns: top operator-feedback themes (real reasons, not bulk)
  - outcomes_summary: improved / flat / regressed of executed actions
  - active_plans: open forward-step commitments per campaign
  - budget_pacing: current month-pace + delta vs prior week
  - tracking_health_status: current snapshot
  - notable_events: campaign status changes (paused → active, etc.)

Contract: §11.6 (JSON stdout, exit 0/1/2).
