"""
tools/check_business_alignment.py — detect drift between creative content and business_knowledge.products.

Phase 4 of the Campaigner Mastery Plan (docs/plans/campaigner-mastery-plan.md
§7). The gap this closes: an operator can update `business_knowledge.products`
to one description ("influencer marketing platform"), but the actual live ads
may sell something else ("AI chatbot for websites"). The agent's diagnosis
heuristics — vertical, customer angle, brand voice — all key off products, so
a drift means the agent is reasoning about the wrong product.

For each non-archived gallery row with copy:
  1. Tokenize creative `primary_text` + `headline` into Hebrew n-grams.
  2. Tokenize each product's `description` + `name` the same way.
  3. Compute Jaccard overlap.
  4. Classify alignment per row: aligned / mixed / drifted.
  5. Return a per-row + aggregate verdict.

This is a deterministic check — no LLM call needed. v1.1 can add a Claude API
semantic compare for nuanced matches; v1 catches the obvious drift (Aiweon's
products text vs. its actual ads) which is the main use case.

Output: summary JSON with per-creative scores + aggregate `drift_band`
(`aligned` / `mixed` / `drifted`). §T_CR (Creative Reformat) lane reads this.

Contract: §11.6 (single JSON on stdout, exit 0/1/2).
