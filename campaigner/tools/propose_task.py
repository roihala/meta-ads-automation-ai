"""
tools/propose_task.py — insert a row into `approvals` (the HITL queue).

This is the ONLY way Claude can propose an action to a human. The agent
never acts on Meta directly from the observe-propose flow — every change
goes through this table, which is read by `execute_approvals.sh` after a
human (or auto-approval rule) flips `status='approved'`.

Exit codes per contract §11.6 (0 / 1 / 2).
