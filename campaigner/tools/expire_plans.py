"""
tools/expire_plans.py — flip pending plans_carryover rows past their TTL to
`status='expired'`. Cron-friendly cleanup so the audit trail stays readable.

Built 2026-05-13 PM with migration 023. Without this, expired plans linger
as `status='pending'` even though every read path filters by
`expires_at > now()` — query results stay correct but the operator-facing
view shows confusing "open" plans that are actually dead.

Invoked: nightly cron, or inline at the end of Flow A. Idempotent.

Contract: §11.6 (JSON stdout, exit 0/1/2).
