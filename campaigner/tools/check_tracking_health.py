tools/check_tracking_health.py — pre-gate for every Meta-spending proposal.

M1 in decision-map.md / cheeky-seeking-blossom.md §M1. The first link in the
causal chain of diagnosis: if Pixel/CAPI is broken, every downstream signal
the agent reads (conversions, CPA, CPL, ROAS, fatigue ratio) is unreliable —
the agent must alert the operator and refuse to make scaling / creative-add
recommendations on untrusted data.

Reads `business_knowledge.tracking_*` fields (added in migration 008):
  - tracking_verified       — bool, operator-attested "all four green"
  - tracking_pixel_id       — text, the Pixel currently wired
  - tracking_capi_configured — bool, deduplicated CAPI events flowing
  - tracking_aem_priority_events — jsonb, the 8 priority events ranked
  - tracking_domain_verified — text, the verified domain (Meta requires)

For MVP this is the **operator-attested** state — the agent trusts the DB.
A v2 follow-up will add a live Meta call to fetch Pixel event rate + match
quality + last-seen timestamp, and compute a `tracking_freshness_score`.
That's deferred because the Meta API surface for Pixel diagnostics is non-
trivial and the operator-attested flag covers the 90% case (a brand-new
account that hasn't wired CAPI yet).
