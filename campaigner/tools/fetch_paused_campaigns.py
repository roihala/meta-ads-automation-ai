"""
tools/fetch_paused_campaigns.py — list paused campaigns + last-30d performance.

Built 2026-05-13 to support decision-tree §T_PA (Paused Campaign Audit). The
agent reads paused campaigns once per run and classifies each into:

  - `revival_candidate`        — CPL ≤ 1.2× target AND CTR ≥ 1.5% (worth re-visiting)
  - `narrow_audience_revival`  — CPM > 80 IL AND impressions < 5000 (cheap with expand)
  - `archive_candidate`        — neither of the above (leave paused)

Classification thresholds live here (one place) — the decision-tree prompt
references the lanes by name and reads `lane` from this output verbatim.

Contract: §11.6 (JSON stdout, exit 0/1/2).
